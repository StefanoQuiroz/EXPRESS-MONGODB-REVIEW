# Fake-API

To solidify the concepts of making our own API, let's create an API that generates a random user in a GET request. We will use Postman to make our GET requests.

In this task, we will use 2 javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates a User and/or Company depending on the path:

Express (server)
Faker (fake data generator)
